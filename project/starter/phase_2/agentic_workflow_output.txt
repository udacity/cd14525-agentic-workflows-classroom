As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I want to receive only relevant, complex inquiries to improve efficiency and job satisfaction.

Tasks:
1. Define criteria for categorizing inquiries as complex and relevant to the SME.
2. Participate in training sessions to understand the routing logic and system capabilities.
3. Review and provide feedback on the accuracy of inquiries routed to you.
4. Monitor the system's performance in directing complex inquiries to the appropriate SMEs.

User Story 3:
As an IT Administrator, I am responsible for system configuration, maintenance, and monitoring performance metrics.

Tasks:

 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer does not meet the criteria. The answer provided includes detailed tasks related to user stories but does not follow the specified format for user stories. The format requires each user story to start with "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." The provided answer does not present the user stories in this format.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, the worker agent needs to reformat the user stories to follow the specified format. Each user story should start with "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." Here's how the worker agent can correct the user stories:

Original Answer:
- Task 1: Create a login page for users to enter their credentials.
- Task 2: Implement a search functionality to allow users to find products easily.
- Task 3: Develop a checkout process for users to complete their purchases.

Corrected Answer:
- As a user, I want to have a login page to enter my credentials so that I can access my account securely.
- As a user, I want a search functionality to easily find products so that I can quickly locate items I am interested in.
